# Bananas_Sales_Analysis

### Project Overview

Bananas offers subscriptions to their online platform for project management. Bananas' sales data was explored from July 2019 through June 2021, which is organized by Customer ID and Sales Month. Bananas data analysis aim to provide insights into the sales performance of a subscription based SaaS(software as a service) start-up company. By analyzing the sales data, we aim to find trends, gain insight into customers behaviour, predict sales and gain a deeper understanding of the company's present and future financial performance in sales.

### Data Sources

The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Bananas Sales.xlsx" file, containing detailed account history of the company, which include the customer ID, sales month and subscription type of its customers.

### Tools

- Microsoft Excel
- Data Cleaning and Preparation | Data Analysis

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the preparation stage, the following tasks was peformed
- Data loading, cleaning, exploration and questioning.
 - Irrelevant Columns was removed and relevant ones was added which include:
 - upsell $ per non-paying user
 - non-paying users
 - current upsell $
 - upsell priority
 - upsell account detail

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA of Bananas sales help us gain insight into understanding customer profile and behaviour, find correlation and sales trend and also generate hypothesis for further analysis. The following was observed:
1. Bananas have 55,658 number of users, 35,101 subscribers and $693,025 sales amount, averaging $312 per month.
2. Bananas sell their platform subscriptions at various levels for different prices. Basic users enjoy a "freemium" experience, a free product with limited use. Premium users pay $10 per license, Business users pay $25 per license, and Enterprise users negotiate their price.

### Data Analysis
1. Subscription Type and Licenses Bought grouped to know the total amount of sales for each paid subscription. $4,110 was the sales amount for Enterprise
2. Sales month and subscription type was sliced to gain better understanding of sales trend in each grouped sunscription type.
3. Senior management is looking to identify upsell opportunities. Upsell means getting non-paying accounts to convert to paying accounts of Basic to $10, premium to $10, business to $25 and Enterprise to $27. The total upsell would have been $272,473 if Bananas had all their users paying.
4. Even though we found out how much money Bananas could have made had if they had all their customers paying, it does not address which accounts our customer success team should target for upsell opportunities.
